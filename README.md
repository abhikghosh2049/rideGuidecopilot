## Project Architecture

The project follows Next.js App Router architecture with a component-based structure, featuring a conversational chat interface for ride comparison, responsive design optimized for mobile devices, and integration with multiple ride-hailing services (Ola, Uber, InDrive, Rapido). The application uses a modern violet-themed design system with authentic service logos and supports both car and bike booking options based on passenger count.
